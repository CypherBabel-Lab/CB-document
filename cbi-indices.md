# CBI Indices

## Resolutions and Timestamps

### Time Window Resolutions

CBI indices' time windows are available in the following resolutions:

* All
* 1 year (1Y)
* 1 month (1M)
* 1 week (1W)
* 1 day (1D)
* 1 hour (1H)

Time window resolution means the **time window** over which a metric is being aggregated.

### Data Point Resolutions

CBI indices' data points are available in the following resolutions:

* 1 day (for "All" and "1 year" time windows)
* 2 hours (for "1 month" time window)
* 30 minutes (for "1 week" time window)
* 5 minutes (for "1 day" time window)
* 1 minute (for "1 hour" time window)

Data point resolution means the **frequency** at which the data is being updated.

For instance, the CIC55 on a 1D time window resolution shows the index level over 24 hours with a data point resolution of 5 minutes. The same mechanism is applied analogously to all other resolutions.
